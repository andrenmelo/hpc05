# hpc05
ðŸ–¥ Client package for local TU Delft cluster

Script that connects to PBS cluster with headnode. Since `ipyparallel` doesn't cull enginges when inactive and people are lazy (because they forget to `qdel` their jobs), it automatically kills the `ipengines` after two hours of inactivity.


Make sure you can connect over `ssh` passwordless:
```
ssh-agent -a ~/ssh-agent.socket
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/ssh-agent.socket
ssh-add
```
