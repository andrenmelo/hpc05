# hpc05
ðŸ–¥ Client package for local TU Delft cluster

Script that connects to PBS cluster with headnode. Since `ipyparallel` doesn't cull enginges when inactive and people are lazy (because they forget to `qdel` their jobs), it automatically kills the `ipengines` after two hours of inactivity.


Make sure you can connect over `ssh` passwordless:
```
ssh-agent -a ~/ssh-agent.socket
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/ssh-agent.socket
ssh-add
```

Further a parallel profile called `pbs` on the `hpc05`, which can be created by the following command on your local machine:
```
import hpc05
hpc05.create_remote_pbs_profile(username, hostname='hpc05')
```

Then start a cluster, run on hpc05:

```
ipcluster start --profile=pbs --n=20
```
